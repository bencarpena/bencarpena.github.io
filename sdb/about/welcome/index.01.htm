         <em> <span class=published title="Parish website has been resurrected!">Our Parish website has been resurrected! Alleluia! </span></em>
         <br /><br />
         I understand that in the time of Fr. Ernie, there has been already an existing website. But since it has not been updated for a long time, it is unavailable anymore. 
        <br /><br />
        I find the necessity of resurrecting it because I believe it is a powerful means to communicate with you, our parishioners. It is a venue to inform you what is going on in the parish church and in our community. It could also be a vehicle not only of news and announcements but also of evangelization and teachings. It can even be a place for dialogue and exchange of ideas for the good of the community.
        <br /><br />
        Our website is very timely because there will be a lot of liturgical services and activities that will take place this coming months of December and January. You will be informed beforehand about these events in order to help you prepare yourselves spiritually for a meaningful celebration.
        <br /><br />
        I trust that you will make use of this website to be informed of what is happening in the parish and hopefully, for you to be involved in the parish activities. There will be forthcoming seminars and teachings which will be very useful to the families. I expect every parishioner to participate, not only during Sunday worship but also in the formation talks. Our website will also inform you of the activities of the different ministries and how you can join them and share your time and your talents for the good of our neighbors.
        <br /><br />
        A very big thanks to the two persons who have helped me to start initially this website project. May God reward them for their effort and generosity.
        <br /><br />
        May God bless each and every one of you and your families through the intercession of Mary Help of Christians and of St. John Bosco.
      <br /><br /><br />
      Yours in Christ,
      <br /><br />
