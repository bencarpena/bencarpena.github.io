            <span lang="EN-PH">Dear Parishioners,</span><br /><br />
         Greetings of Peace and Love!
        <br /><br />
        I am sorry if I have not updated our website lately. Due to heavy work load in the Parish and considering the fact that we have only two priests assigned at the parish this school year, compared to the four priests during the time of our former parish priest, Fr. Ernie, I could not cope up with the revision and updating of our website.
        <br /><br />
        I have now in mind asking the help of some of you who have the time and the talent to assist me in regularly putting new information and news in our website so that it does not remain stagnant. I will greatly appreciate if one of you can volunteer to be part of the Communication ministry of the parish, in-charge of updating our website.
        <br /><br />
        We have successfully organized the Healing Mass of Fr. Suarez last month of July. Aside from the great number of volunteers, we have about 3000 people who came to ask for healing. I have already communicated my congratulations to the volunteers and to the donors who gave their time, skills and resources to make the event successful.
        <br /><br />
        One of the things I am grateful about is that the event has concretized the unity, camaraderie and solidarity of the parishioners, particularly for those who volunteered to help in the event. The different committees with their numerous members have manifested their generosity and teamwork. This kind of activity has helped in fostering not only the unity of the parish but also in activating the generosity of the parishioners in helping to organize a big event like this one for God’s greater glory and the welfare of our people.
        <br /><br />
        The healing process would not have happened in an orderly way if there were no volunteers to help in organizing the activity. Somehow, the healer is not only Fr. Suarez but all those who have helped in making the event peaceful and orderly. While there are small incidents of confusion particularly when the healing activity was already taking place, they are insignificant compared to the overall orderly procedure, due to the assistance of the volunteers.
        <br /><br />
        Thus, we thank the Lord for the grace of healing, we thank Fr. Suarez for being the instrument of the Lord and we also thank the organizers, the donors and the volunteers who have helped to make the healing process successful, orderly and fruitful.
        <br /><br />
        This coming month of <b>August</b>, we will have the image of the <b>Black Nazarene of Quiapo</b> in our parish from <b>August 4 to 7</b>. We invite you to join us in the <b>prayer vigil</b> starting the eve of Thursday, August 4 and continued in the evening of Friday and Saturday, August 5 and 7. The image will be brought to the different Barangay and Villages in the afternoon of August 6, Saturday, for the people living there to give homage to the miraculous image of the Black Nazarene. The image will have the farewell Mass on Sunday, August 7, at 4:30 pm and will depart from our parish after the Mass. Since this is the image of our Lord who carried our cross to calvary for our salvation, we expect this visit of the image to bring about healing, renewal and conversion to our people especially those who are in need.
        <br /><br />
        I would like also to remind you of the feast of the <b>Assumption of our Blessed Mother on August 15, Monday</b>. In other countries, this feast is a holiday of obligation. While this is not the practice in our country, we hope that many of you will give veneration and honour to the Blessed Mother during the days she will be with us. Remember that the feast is an invitation for us to put our hope in our own resurrection on the last day, in the same way that the Blessed Mother resurrected and assumed into heaven. May it give hope to those who are suffering and are burdened in this world, because our true consolation and reward will be the eternal happiness in heaven together with Mary.
        <br /><br />
        May the kindness of the Lord be with you always and may your families receive at all times the blessing of God through the intercession of our Blessed Mother.
      <br /><br /><br />
      
      Yours in St. John Bosco,
      <br /><br />
